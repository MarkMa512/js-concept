### Application 

1. Promise is great when when need to do something that takes a long time in the back ground such as downloading images from a different server, intead of making everything else wait for it, just do something after it is completed. We can also catch it to see if it is a fail.
2. Used to replace callbacks:  
   - Instead of using nested call backs that lead s to call back hells
   - Promise: .then()
